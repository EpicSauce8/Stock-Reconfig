REQUIRED: Install latest version of ModuleManager. (You probably already have this. If you don't: http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/ search for module manager)
Install the EpicContents folder to gamedata. (Just like every other mod.)
Enjoy. (Like only needing to push one button on the remote to watch your favorite show.)

If the parachute values are not to your liking, edit the numbers in the file to what you would normally set it to ingame.
These files do not remove any capabilities of the parts themselves, just disables them or adjusts values, or removes fuel.
